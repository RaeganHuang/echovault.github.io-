# Echo vault-

Hi, I am Raegan. I wrote this package for, during my first year’s commitment to gender CSO, one of our sister organizations’ account got officially banned without any legitimized reason and we felt devastated for all the precious published writings gone. As the communication officer, I started this project and did daily back-ups every week.

On the day of national women’s day, also my one year’s anniversary as a queer feminist activist, my serving NGO’s WeChat public account got eternally, violently silenced with no reason as well. I was devastated for this catastrophe happened, but simultaneously lucky for the team had this technology prepared.

I hope the digital grave, or positively saying as I named it, Project Echo Vault is useful for your organizations or personal writing, and wish you will never need to use this. The package is very handful and an easy access, including uploading local files to Github and writing Markdown code. These can be easily done by carefully following the steps.
